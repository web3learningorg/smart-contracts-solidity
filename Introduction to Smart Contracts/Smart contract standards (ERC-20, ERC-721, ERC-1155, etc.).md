# ERC-20 vs ERC-721: Key Differences in Ethereum Token Standards

Trading in NFTs surged to **$17.6 billion in 2021**, highlighting the importance of understanding Ethereum token standards. ERC-20 and ERC-721 are the two foundational standards for fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) respectively, while ERC-1155 provides a versatile multi-token solution for complex applications like Web3 gaming.

## Key Points

- **ERC-20 Tokens**: Fungible, interchangeable, and ideal for cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and voting tokens. Functions include `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `approve`, and `allowance`.  
- **ERC-721 Tokens**: Non-fungible, unique, and suitable for digital art, collectibles, gaming assets, and tokenized real estate. Features include unique `tokenId`, ownership verification, and metadata URIs.  
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard allowing both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract. Supports batch operations, efficiency, and flexibility—perfect for games and metaverse projects.  

## Choosing the Right Standard

| Standard | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| ERC-20 | Currency, voting, utility tokens |
